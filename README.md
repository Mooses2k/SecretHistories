<i>A dead God lies dreaming beneath Ribblehead.<br>
A comet sighting brings with it the glory of the Fifth World.<br>
Star-crazed cultists call to the Constellation Starfish.<br>
Explore, sneak, loot, survive, escape.<br>
Go die in a hole.</i><br>

Simulationist dungeon delving:
* Procedurally generated dungeon levels
* Realistic light-levels and stealth
* Intricate impact and object-dragging sound system
* Opponents can detect noise, your light-sources, etc
* Hardcore old-school OSR D&D gameplay
* Detailed main-hand and off-hand inventory system with intuitive controls
* Hundreds of voice lines by talented voice actors

Some inspiration touchstones:
* Thief: the Dark Project
* Amnesia: The Dark Descent
* Pathways Into Darkness
* Lost In Vivo
* Monstrum
* Receiver
* Hellish Quart
* SCP Foundation

The project is GPLv3 open-source and the intention is to make a platform for anyone to make their own adventures in this system without reinventing the wheel. 

Two and a half years in the making, so far. Finally have something decent to show.

Anyone is welcome to help - first timers and GODOT pros alike! Just comment here or PM me.
