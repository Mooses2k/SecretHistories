# Secret Histories
Alien Swarm meets Infra Arcana.

Anyone is welcome to help - first timers and GODOT pros alike!

Eventually, with JSON support and more documentation, it will be easy to make your own levels, campaigns, items, and enemies. For now, the game is entirely in GDScript, so requires Godot 3.4 for any improvements.

The design doc is in the form of the Github wiki here: https://github.com/Mooses2k/HotlineCthulhu/wiki
